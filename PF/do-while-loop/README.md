TASK-1:aaaa
Write a program that reads the current state of telephone line. The user should enter
w for working and d for dead state. Any other input should be considered invalid.
Use do-while loop to force the user to enter a valid input value.
Sample Output:
Press w for working state and d for dead state
Enter the state of your phone: g
Enter the state of your phone: 2
Enter the state of your phone: d
Noted, your phone is in dead state.

TASK-2: 
Write an infinite loop that never ends. Condition is always true.

TASK-3: 
Write a program that input a number from user and find the sum of its digits.
Sample Output:
Input 123 sum=6
Input 12345 sum=15

TASK-4: 
Write a program to find the sum of odd and even numbers from 1 to N.
Sample Output:
Enter the value of num 10
Sum of all odd numbers = 25
Sum of all even numbers = 30

TASK-5: 
Two numbers are amicable if the first is equal to the sum of divisors of the second,
and if the second number is equal to the sum of divisors of the first. Write a
program that finds whether two numbers entered by user are amicable or not.
Hint:
Â One can easily check that the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 +
142 = 220 and the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20
+ 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284. So 284 and 220 are amicable.
