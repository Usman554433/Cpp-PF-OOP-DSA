TASK-1:
Implement the following function in C++ called that takes in as input a number N and prints the
first N number of the fibonacci sequence. Please also write the driver program for N = 10 and 15.
void fibonacciSeries(int n)

TASK-2:
Write a program in C++ (using function with parameter passed in by reference) for finding the
character grade against marks out of 100. The character grade is determined as follows:
- If the marks are more than 80 the grade is A
- If the marks are more than 65 but less than 80 the grade is B
- If the marks are more than 50 but less than 65 the grade is C
- If the marks are less than 50 the grade is F
The function’s signature should be as follows:
void calculateGrade( int marks, char &amp;grade)
The driver program should include a loop that lets the user repeat the grade calculation until the
user enters -1.

TASK-3:
void resverse_Array(int arr [ ], int size), Implement the function reverse_Array. Don’t print the array.
Take care of even and odd size. Only function implementation is required. Don’t declare any new array.

TASK-4:
Write a function given an array of integers nums [] and an integer target,and display the indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element
twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
void twoSum(int nums[], int target)
- Example 1:
- Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
- Output: [0,1]
- Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we display [0, 1].

TASK-5:
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, write a function that return the
median of the two sorted arrays.
double findMedianSortedArrays(int nums1[], int nums2[])
- Example 1:
- Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
- Output: 2.00000
- Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

TASK-6:
Write a program which should detect whether a given matrix is identity or not.
An identity matrix is a matrix is a matrix whose diagonal entries are 1 and non-
diagonal entries are 0.

TASK-7:
Write a program for addition/subtraction of two Matrices of same size.
