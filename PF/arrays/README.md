TASK-1:
Implement the following function in C++ called that takes in as input a number N and prints the
first N number of the fibonacci sequence. Please also write the driver program for N = 10 and 15.
void fibonacciSeries(int n)

TASK-2:
Write a program in C++ (using function with parameter passed in by reference) for finding the
character grade against marks out of 100. The character grade is determined as follows:
- If the marks are more than 80 the grade is A
- If the marks are more than 65 but less than 80 the grade is B
- If the marks are more than 50 but less than 65 the grade is C
- If the marks are less than 50 the grade is F
The function’s signature should be as follows:
void calculateGrade( int marks, char &amp;grade)
The driver program should include a loop that lets the user repeat the grade calculation until the
user enters -1.

TASK-3:
void resverse_Array(int arr [ ], int size), Implement the function reverse_Array. Don’t print the array.
Take care of even and odd size. Only function implementation is required. Don’t declare any new array.
