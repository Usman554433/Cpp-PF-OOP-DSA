Task-1: 
You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a program to compute the
result, encoded as an integer value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or
less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more,
the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

Task-2:
Let’s design a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in C++. There are 2 players and both of them simultaneously say their words ("P" for paper, "S" for scissors, and "R" for rock). The rules of the
game are fairly simple.
- Rock dominates Scissors
- Paper dominates Rock
- Scissors dominate Paper
If player-1 says ‘P’ and player-2 says ‘R’, you'll print "Player 1 wins". Likewise if player-1 says ‘P’ and player-2 says ‘S’, you'll print "Player 2 wins" and so on. If both the players say the same word, it's a draw.

Task-3:
Write a C++ code to find the grade from marks. The user is required to input marks obtained and then the program gives him a grade according to his marks. The gradingscale is shown below:
  Marks     Grade
- 90-100    A+
- 80-89     A
- 70-79     B
- 60-69     C
- 50-59     D
- 00-49     F

Task-4: 
Write a program that convert double (Data Type) to Integer (Data Type) using Implicit type conversion and Explicit type conversion.

Task-5: 
Write a program that that divide two numbers and shows the result with and without Typecasting.
