TASK-1:
Write a program in C++ that checks if a number entered by the user is
Palindrome or not.
Palindrome: A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of
characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or
racecar or the number 10201
For example: 11211 is palindrome 1222 is not a palindrome. 4444 is a
palindrome.

TASK-2:
The following C++ code segments can be used to print n spaces or n * on
the output device/stream
Code segment to print spaces
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
cout<<"";
Code Segment to print *
for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)
cout<<"*";
Use these code segments within a loop to create programs that can print
the following patterns Filled Square of height H The value of H will be given
by the user Sample output for H = 8
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * *

Hollow Square of height H The value of H will be given by the user
Sample output for H = 6
* * * * * *
*         *
*         *
*         *
*         *
* * * * * *

TASK-3:
Write a C++ program to prints the first n terms of the following Fibonacci
series. The value of n is taken as input.
The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series, i.e.,
for n = 10 are as follows:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
So the first two terms are 1 and 1 and every successive term is sum of the
previous two terms.
