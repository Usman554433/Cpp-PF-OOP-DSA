TASK-1: 
Write a C++ program that declares and initializes an integer array dynamically. The input array
should only contain 0s and 1s in random order. Segregate 0s on left side and 1s on right side of
the array.
- Input:
- 10110101
- Output:
- 00011111

TASK-2: 
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which every number after the first two is the sum of the two
preceding ones. Write a C++ program that takes a number n from user and populate a dynamic
array with first n Fibonacci numbers.
- For example:
- For n=10
- Fibonacci Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55

TASK-3: 
Write a C++ program that takes the size ‘n’ of array and a number ‘x’ as input from user and
declares and initializes an integer array dynamically. Then take any m numbers from user as
input and store in the array (where m < n).
The program should print the occurrence of ‘x’ (Number of times ‘x’ occurred in array). Then it
should print the number of free slots available in array and shrink the array (Delete free slots
present in array)

- For Example:
- Input:
- Please enter size: 9
- Please the number to find the occurrence: 5
- Please enter elements: 1 3 5 6 4 5
- Output:
- Occurrence of 5: 2
- Number of free slots: 3
