TASK-1:
A C++ program “Encrypt” that creates a dynamic char array of size defined by the user. Then
takes input of that array from the user and resize the original array to size equal to the number of
characters entered by the user.
Your function now asks the user to enter encryption key that can be any alphabet (a-z, A-Z).
Encrypt function adds the ASCII of encryption key to each char of your input array to generate
encrypted sentence. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front
of the alphabet. In the case of a shift factor of 3 the message “wxyz” would map to “zabc” i.e. w
becomes z, x becomes a, y becomes b and z becomes c.
Note: Array subscript notation cannot be used.
- For Example:
- INPUT: 
- Enter Size of array: 100
- Enter the array elements: This is object oriented class
- Enter the encryption key: d
- OUTPUT: 
- New Size of array: 29
- Encrypted array: Pdeojeojkxfaypjkneajpazjyhwoo
