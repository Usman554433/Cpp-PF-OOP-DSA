TASK-1: 
As we already know that a class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint/
plan/template that describes the details of an object.
Your task is to design a class for Student which contains constructors, getters, setters, input
function and print function.
- a) You must take any 5 necessary data members as Roll No, Name, CNIC, Degree and
Address
- b) Implement constructors, getters, setters, input function and print function
- c) Create the objects of Student class. If no name is passed while creating the object of
Student class then the data members should have ‘0 or ‘Unknown’ values, otherwise
assign the values(any) passed while creating the object of Student class
- d) Use getter and print functions to print the values of data members
- e) Now take the data as input from user and assign values using setter function
- f) Print the values using print function

- NOTE: Make sure that you create 3 separate files, .h file to declare class and its members,
imp.cpp file for implementation member function of class. Driver.cpp file for main() function.
