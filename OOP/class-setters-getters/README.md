TASK-1: 
As we already know that a class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint/
plan/template that describes the details of an object.
Your task is to design a class for Student which contains constructors, getters, setters, input
function and print function.
- a) You must take any 5 necessary data members as Roll No, Name, CNIC, Degree and
Address
- b) Implement constructors, getters, setters, input function and print function
- c) Create the objects of Student class. If no name is passed while creating the object of
Student class then the data members should have ‘0 or ‘Unknown’ values, otherwise
assign the values(any) passed while creating the object of Student class
- d) Use getter and print functions to print the values of data members
- e) Now take the data as input from user and assign values using setter function
- f) Print the values using print function

- NOTE: Make sure that you create 3 separate files, .h file to declare class and its members,
imp.cpp file for implementation member function of class. Driver.cpp file for main() function.

TASK-2:
- Exercise 1:
- Create a class Date having following private data members:
Int Day, 
 ,Int Month
 ,Int Year
- Create an object of Date “date1” and run your program

- Exercise 2 [Default Constructor]:
- Write a default Constructor of Date that initializes the object to 1st January 1926 and prints
“Default Constructor Called” in start.
- Now run your program and test what does date1 prints?
- Exercise 3 [Print Function]:
- Implement a function Print in Date class which prints a date in following format:
dd/mm/yyyy (e.g. 1/1/1926 for date1)
- Print object date1 in your main function and run the program.
- What does it print and how can we initialize the data of date1 at the time of creation?

- Exercise 4 [Input Function]:
- Write a function Input in your Date class that takes input from user to populate a Date object.
- Call “date1.Input()” and “date1.Print()” in your driver program and test it.

- Exercise 5 [Setters]:
- Create an object xmasDay using default constructor.
- Print xmasDay and see what it prints.
- Write Setters i.e. SetDay, SetMonth and SetYear in your class.
- Now set xmasDay to 25/12/2020 using Setters in main.

- Exercise 6 [Getters]:
- Write Getters i.e. GetDay, GetMonth and GetYear in your date class.
Now print xmasDay using Getters in your Driver program.


TASK-3:
- a) Write the definition of constructor 1 so that the private data members are initialized to 0.
- b) Write the definition of constructor 2 so that the private data member x is initialized according
to the value of the parameter, and the private data member y is initialized to 0.
- c) Write the definition of constructor 3 and 4 so that the private data members are initialized to
according to the values of parameters.
