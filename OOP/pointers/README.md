TASK-1:
Write a program that asks the user to enter integers as inputs to be stored in the variables
'a' and 'b' respectively. There are also two integer pointers named ptrA and ptrB. Assign
the values of 'a' and 'b' to ptrA and ptrB respectively, and display them.

TASK-2:
Write C++ program which takes a string of max 20 size as input from the user and find the length
of string and also the count of vowel and consonant by using pointers.
For Example:
Input:
Please enter string: Pointers
Output:
String Length: 8
Vowel: 3
Consonant: 5

TASK-3:
Write C++ program which takes five numbers as input from the user and find their average.
For Example:
Input:
Please enter five numbers: 6 9 3 5 7
Output:
Average is 6

TASK-4:
Write a C++ program that takes a number n from user and check is number palindrome or not
using pointer.
For Example:
Input:
Please enter number: 46729
Output:
Number is not a palindrome.
Input:
Please enter number: 53235
Output:
Number is a palindrome.

TASK-5:
a) Write a C++ program that finds the median of following three integers using their
pointers.
const int a=5;
const int b=10;
const int c=12â€™
b) Modify your program a little. Try to assign the value -1 to whichever integer occurs to be
the median. The task is to be done through pointers.

TASK-6:
Write a C++ program which takes an n digit number as user input and check the number is
Armstrong or not. The numbers must pass as Passing pointers to functions by value and by
reference.
For Example:
Input:
Please enter number: 153
Output:
Number is Armstrong.
Working:
(1)^3 + (5)^3 + (3)^3 = 153
